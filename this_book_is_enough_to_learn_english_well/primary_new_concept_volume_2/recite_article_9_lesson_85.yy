Never too old to learn #活到老学到老

I have just received a letter from my old school, informing me that
my former headmaster, Mr. Stuart Page, will be retiring next week. 
Pupils of the school, old and new, will be sending him a present to
mark the occasion. All those who have contributed towards the gift 
will sign their names in a large album which will be sent to the 
headmaster's home. We shall all remember Mr.Page for his patience 
and understanding and for the kindly encouragement he gave us when 
we went so unwillingly to school. A great mnay former pupils will 
be attending a farewell dinner in his honour next Thursday. It is a
curious coincidence that the day before his retirement, Mr.Page 
will have been teaching for a total of forty years. After he has 
retired, he will devote himself to gardening. For him, this will be 
an entirely new hobby. But this does not matter, for, as has often 
remarked, one is never too old to learn.

#我刚刚收到母校的一封信，通知我说以前的校长斯图亚特•佩奇先生下星期
#就退休了。为了纪念这个日子，学校的学生——无论老同学还是新同学——将送
#他一件礼物。所有凑钱买此礼品的人都将自己的名字签在一本大签名簿上，
#签名簿将被送到校长的家里。我们不会忘记佩奇先生对我们既有耐心又充满
#理解，也不会忘记在我们不愿去上学时它给予我们的亲切鼓励。很多老同学
#都准备参加下周四为他举行的告别宴会。佩奇先生退休的前一天正好是他执
#教满40年的日子，这真是奇妙的巧合。他退休后，将致力于园艺。对于他来
#说，这将是一种全新的爱好。但这没有关系，因为正如他常说的那样，人要
#活到老学到老。
