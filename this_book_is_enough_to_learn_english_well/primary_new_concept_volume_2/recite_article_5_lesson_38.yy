Everything except the weather #唯独没有考虑到天气

My old friend, Harrison, had lived in the Mediterranean for many 
years before he returned to England. He had often dreamed of 
retiring in England and had planned to settle down in the country.
He had no sooner returned than he bought a house and went to live
there. Almost immediately he began to complain about the weather,
for even though it was still summer, it rained continually and it
was often bitterly cold. After so many years of sunshine, Harrison
got a shock. He acted as if he had never lived in England before.
In the end, it was more than he could bear. He had hardly had time
to settle down when he sold the house and left the country. The 
dream he had had for so many years ended there. Harrison had 
thought of everything except the weather.

#我的老朋友哈里森在回到英国以前曾多年居住在地中海地区。过去他常幻想
#退休后到英国，并计划在乡间安顿下来。他刚一回到英国便买下了一幢房子
#住了进去。但紧接着他就开始抱怨那里的天气了。因为即使那时仍为夏季，
#但雨总是下个不停，而且常常冷的厉害。在阳光下生活了那么多年的哈里森
#对此感到惊奇。他的举动就好像他从未在英国生活过一样。最后，他再也忍
#受不住，还没等安顿下来就卖掉了房子，离开了这个国家。他多年来的幻想
#从此破灭。哈里森把每件事情都考虑到了，唯独没有想到天气。
