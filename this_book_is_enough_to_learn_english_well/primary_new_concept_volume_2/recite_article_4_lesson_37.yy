The Olympic Games #奥林匹克运动会

The Olympic Games will be held in our country in four years' time.
As a great many people will be visiting the country, the government
will be building new hotels, an immense stadium, and a new 
Olympic-standard swimming pool. They will also be building new 
roads and a special railway line. The Games will be held just 
outside the capital and the whole area will be called 
'Olympic City'. Workers will have completed the new roads by the 
end of this year. By the end of next year, they will have finished 
work on the new stadium. The fantastic modern buildings have been 
designed by Kurt Gunter. Everybody will be watching anxiously 
as the new buildings go up. We are all very excited and are looking
forward to the Olympic Games because they have never been held 
before in this country.

#4年以后，奥林匹克运动会将在我们国家举行。由于将有大批的人到我们国
#家来，所以政府准备建造一些新的饭店、一个大型体育场和一个新的奥运会
#标准游泳池。他们还将建筑一些新的道路和一条铁路专线。奥运会就在首都
#市郊举办，整个地区将被称作“奥林匹克城”。工人们将在今年年底前把新
#路铺好；到明年年底，他们将把新体育场建成。这些巨大的现代化建筑是由
#库尔特•冈特设计的。大家都将急切地注视着新建筑的建成。斗门都非常激
#动，盼望着奥运会的到来，因为在这个国家还从未举办过奥运会。
