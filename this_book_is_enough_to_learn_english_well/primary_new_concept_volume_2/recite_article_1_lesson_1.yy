A Private Conversation #私人谈话

Last Week I went to the theatre. I had a very good seat. The Play 
was very interesting. I did not enjoy it. A young man and a young 
woman were sitting behind me. They were talking loudly. I got very
angry. I cound not hear the actors. I turned round. I looked at the
man the woman angrily. They did not pay any attention. In the end, 
I could not bear it. I turned round again. 'I can't hear a word !' 
I said angrily.
'It's none of your business,' the young man said rudely. 'This is
a private conversation!'

#上星期我去看戏。我的座位很好，戏很有意思，但我却无法欣赏。一青年男
#子与一青年女子坐在我的身后，大声地说着话。我非常生气，因为我听不见
#演员在说什么。我回过头去怒视着那一男一女，他们却毫不理会。最后，我
#忍不住了，又一次回过头去，生气地说：“我一个字也听不见了！”
#“不关你的事，”那男的毫不客气地说，“这是私人间的谈话！”
