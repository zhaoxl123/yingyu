A wet night #雨夜

Late in the afternoon, the boys put up their tent in the middle of 
a field. As soon as this was done, the cooked a meal over an open 
fire. They were all hungry and the food smelled good. After a 
wonderful meal, the told stories and sang songs by the campfile. 
But some time later it began to rain. The boys felt tired so they 
put out the fire and crept into their tent. Their sleeping bags 
were warm and comfortable, so they all slept soundly. In the middle
of the night, two boys woke up and began shouting. The tent was 
full of water! They all leapt out of their sleeping bags and 
hurried outside. It was raining heavily and they found that a 
stream had formed in the field. The stream wound its way across the
field and then flowed right under their tent!

#傍晚时分，孩子们在田野中央搭起了帐篷。这件事刚刚做完，他们就在篝火
#上烧起了饭。他们全都饿了，饭菜散发出阵阵香味。他们美美地吃了一顿饭
#后，就围在篝火旁讲起了故事，唱起了歌。但过了一阵子，天下起雨来，于
#是他们扑灭了篝火，钻进了帐篷。睡袋既暖和又舒服，所以，他们都睡得很
#香。午夜前后，有两个孩子醒了，大声叫了起来。原来帐篷里到处都是水！
#他们全都跳出睡袋，跑到外面。雨下得很大，他们发现地上已经形成了一条
#小溪。那小溪弯弯曲曲穿过田野，然后正好从他们的帐篷底下流过去！
