The Greenwood Boys #绿林少年

The Greenwood Boys are a group of pop singers. At present, they 
are visiting all parts of the country. They will be arriving 
here tomorrow. They will be coming by train and most of the 
young people in the town will be meeting them at the station. 
Tomorrow evening they will be singing at the Workers' Club. The 
Greenwood Boys will be staying for five days. During this time, 
they will give five performances. As usual, the police will have 
a difficult time. They will be trying to keep order. It is always
the same on these occasions.
