She was not amused #她并不觉得好笑

Jeremy Hampden has a large circle of friends and is very popular at
parties. Everybody admires him for his great sense of humour——
everybody, that is, except his six-year-old daughter, Jenny. 
Recently, one of Jeremy's closest friends asked him to make a 
speech at a wedding reception. This is the sort of thing that 
Jeremy loves. He prepared the speech carefully and went to the 
wedding with Jenny. he had included a large number of funny stories
in the speech and, of course, it was a great success. As soon as he
had finished, Jenny told him she wanted to go home. Jeremy was a 
little disappointed by this but he did as his daughter asked. On 
the way home, he asked Jenny if she had enjoyed the speech. To his 
surprise, she said she hadn't. Jeremy asked her why this was so and 
she told him that she did not like to see so many people laughing 
at him!

#杰里米•汉普登交际甚广，是各种聚会上深受大家欢迎的人。人人都钦佩他
#那绝妙的幽默感——人人，就是说，除他6岁的女儿珍妮之外的每一个人。最
#近，杰里米最亲密的朋友请他在一个婚礼上祝词。这正是杰里米喜欢做的事
#情。他认真准备了讲稿，带着珍妮一道去参加了婚礼。他的祝词里面加进了
#大量逗人的故事，自然大获成功。他刚一讲完，珍妮就对他说她要回家。这
#不免使杰里米有点扫兴，但他还是按照女儿的要求做了。在回家的路上，他
#问珍妮是否喜欢他的祝词。使他吃惊的是，她说她不喜欢。杰里米问她为何
#不喜欢，她说她不愿意看到那么多的人嘲笑他！
